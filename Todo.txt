Task 1 Feb. 22 2021   Generate correct Reddit graph.

Task 2 Feb. 25 2021   Fix HBM reported bandwidth issue.
         Guess this is caused by DRAMSim2 frequence or

         It was DONE. Feb. 25.
         The extra large BW is a bug of DRAMSim2. The introduced
         active_cycles in memory controller can produce reasonable BW.
